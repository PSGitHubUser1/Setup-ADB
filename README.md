 > Settings > Search on top > About Phone / About your Phone > Tap on *Build* (eg. MIUI) version for 7-8 times. And you will become a developer. 
- Go back and search `Developer options` or Scroll down and tap on Additional settings > Developer options
- Click on it and scroll down to turn on `USB debugging` not the `USB debugging (Security settings)`
- Check all things and turn it on.
- And also turn on `Install via USB` (optional)
- Connect your mobile with PC. (Here, I am telling about Windows)

- Type this
```cmd
adb devices
```
- If it shows some Alphabets and numbers under 'List' (like AFG485GT..) then your phone is sucessfully connected to PC already.
- Finally you can run any command. Which you want to run. 

## Here's an example
In **`Android 12`** version, [Specifically, POCO phones] have a green coloured icon of camera & mic on Status Bar at the top of screen whenever you use your mic/camera. Which looks nice at first but not forever. here's an img where the camera is being used and this icon occurs:

- To remove the green icon, you can run this `Android 12`: 
```cmd
adb shell cmd device_config put privacy camera_mic_icons_enabled false default
```
- To revert back [Enable it again]:
```cmd
adb shell cmd device_config put privacy camera_mic_icons_enabled true default
```

### This is how you can setup the `adb`
